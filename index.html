            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create and structure content
                on
                the web. HTML provides a set of elements that web developers can use to describe the structure and
                semantics
                of their web pages. HTML is the backbone of the web, and every web page is written in HTML. It is a
                standard that is supported
                by all modern web browsers, and it is constantly evolving to meet the needs of the web. HTML uses a
                tag-based syntax, where tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Each tag is
                enclosed in angle brackets, like this: &lt;tagname&gt;. Some tags require additional attributes, which
                are
                used to provide additional information about the tag. For example, the &lt;img&gt; tag requires a "src"
                attribute, which specifies the location of the image to be displayed. HTML can be used to create a wide
                variety of content on the web, from simple text and images to complex multimedia applications. With the
                help of CSS and JavaScript, HTML can also be used to create rich and
                interactive user experiences.</p>
